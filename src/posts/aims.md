I've made this site primarily as a place to host bits of work I do from
time to time.

I have a few ideas at the moment, all dancing around in my
head and colliding with each other when I'm supposed to be concentrating
on something more important. Most of all I'm wanting to write here as a 
way to explore evidence to get closer to some truths of human experience
in the early 21st Century.

The articles I hope to write will tell stories, illustrated with graphics,
and created using open source data and technology. Themes will vary a lot,
and will be covered with varying depth.

I'll also be making some tutorials along the way for anyone interested.
