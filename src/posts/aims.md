I've made this site primarily as a place to host bits of work I do from
time to time.

I have a few ideas for articles at the moment, all dancing around in my
head and colliding with each other when I'm supposed to be concentrating
on something more important.

Its a strange time.

Currently, we're in what are apparently the early days of the Covid-19
pandemic. Drastic measures are being taken by governments across the globe
to reduce the pressure on health services. <br />

We're now facing much more time indoors than expected this year. In that
time, I want to create something positive during what will otherwise feel
like a chaotic and concerning period for humanity as a whole.

The articles I hope to write will tell stories, illustrated with graphics,
and created using open source data and technology. Themes will vary a lot,
and will be covered with varying depth.

I'll also be making some tutorials along the way for anyone interested.
