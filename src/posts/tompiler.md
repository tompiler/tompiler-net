Hello, my name is Tom.

I'm a software engineer living in London. 

I'm currently working for Policy in Practice, an exciting company solving policy challenges with data at a local and national level. I'm a tech pessimist, which to me means that I don't believe in blockchain or AI as much as using technology traditionally - to connect people and organisations and deliver social impact by minimising costs of communication between households, firms, and government.

This is me ðŸ‘‡
