Hello, my name is Tom. I'm a software engineer living in London. I currently have the privilege of leading the data engineering team at Policy in Practice, an exciting company solving policy challenges with data at a local and national level.

I've more recently found myself thriving in a hybrid product/engineering role, essentially project managing teams towards achieving a set of complex deliverables, often in the realm of data pipelines and dashboards.

I prefer to work on projects that deliver tangible and positive social value!
